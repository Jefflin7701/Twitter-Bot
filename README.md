# Twitter-Bot

This project was designed with python to create a Twitter Bot that tells the weather of certain locations including New York City, London, Paris, Moscow, Tokyo, Dubai, Singapore, Rome, Los Angeles, and Madrid. Also includes a bunch of other helper functions that could be utilized in the driver function, for different functionalities. For my purposes, I built a Twitter bot that took in information from a weather API and tweeted the weather information obtained by the API for the 10 locations listed above.
